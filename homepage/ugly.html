    <p>
        My name is Gurjog Singh, and I am an international student currently pursuing my undergradute degree
        in Computing Science at the University of Alberta, Edmonton. I will hopefully graduate in 2023 and plan to
        pursure a career in software. I was born in Mombasa, Kenya and lived there my whole life. I enjoy creating working products using the skills I get in and out of class.
        I enjoy working with other like minded individuals to create something that we can actually use in our daily lives.
        Apart from programming, I have several other hobbies that I take pride in as I believe that being multi-dimensional and 
        having different sources of creativity can ultimately make me a better citizen of the world. I enjoy listening to music,
        admiring art, hiking and attending random conventions around the city.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <p>
        2018 - Harambe Clinic Database. I built a working database application using Microsoft Access for a clinic in Mombsa, Kenya.
    They were struggling with managing their data as they manually gathered and searched for information that they wrote in their ledgers.
I successfully developed and helped them transition to a working application that allowed them to easily input and access all the information
they needed. </p>

     <p>  2020 - Internship at Royal Court Hotel, Mombasa. During my internship at the hotel, I was delegated the responsibility to learn, maintain and 
         assist with the DBMS that the hotel was using. During this time, I learnt how Micros Fidelio Suite 8 worked throughout the different aspects 
         of the hotel and learnt the inner workings of the DBMS through discussions with their support staff. I was able to experience how POS systems interacted
         with the DBMS and how the DBMS ensured the flow of data in a consistent and secure manner. 
     </p>

      <p>  2020 - Experiment Counter Mobile Application. As part of a computing course that I took (namely CMPUT 301), I along with 4 other people, built an 
          andriod application that allowed a user to start and store various types of experiments and share these experiemnts with others such that they could
          contribute in the experiemnts as well. I handled the front-end side of the mobile application and aided in the design of the UI and successfully implemented
          the geolocation feature that showed the experiments all across the globe on a map.

        In terms of technical skills, I have experience with programming languages such as Python, Java, Javascript, MySQL, C and MongoDB. The frameworks
        I have worked with are Andriod Studio, Django and ReactJS. I am proficient with the Adobe and Microsoft Suite. On top of that, I am a very fast learner 
        and enjoy taking upon new challenges and learning new skills to solve problems. I enjoy collaborating with people. I have excellent communication, presentation and research skills, and I am 
        team player.  </p>
