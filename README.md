Changes I made to the gutenberg files:

    - I added an old paper like background that gave it a vintage feel.
    - In terms of headers, I added text shadow to give the headers some depth
    and give a cool and subtle 3D effect. I also imported some Google serif fonts
    to differentiate the title from the other headers and other text. I italicised
    some headers. I also changed the margins of the headings to give the
    webpage more space, for a more comfortable reading experience.
    - I tried my best to change the fonts and styles of the different headers and text so that
    the reader could easily distinguish between the different types of text shown.
    - I changed the chapter anchor tag style from the odd blue and red combo to black and grey
    to make it look more aesthetically pleasing.
    - In terms of paragraphs, I increased the line spacing to make reading more comfortable,
    I changed the font to something more modern and easy on the eyes. For special paragraphs,
    such as poems, I changed their style by italicising or changing their size and font
    so that they could stand out and easily be distinguished as a different type of text.
    - For the images, I altered their sizes and added a box shadow to give a cool 3D look.
    I also customised their captions (if they had any).
